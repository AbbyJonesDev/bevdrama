            <h2> Synopsis </h2>
            <p>
               Defying the village matchmaker, Mulan takes up arms and 
               disguises as a boy in order to spare her father from having 
               to serve in the army. The Huns have invaded, and it is up to 
               the misfit Mulan and her mischievous sidekick Mushu to save 
               the Emperor! Disney's Mulan JR. is a heartwarming celebration 
               of culture, honor, and the fighting spirit.
